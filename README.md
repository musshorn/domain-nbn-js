Domain NBN User Script
=============

Userscript + database (for the interested) that shows a little tag on the page indicating if the suburb you searched for is NBN active. This only works when searching singular suburbs (so Bondi,Glebe would not work). 

Example

This is only tested and working in Firefox. I'll develop a chrome port sooner or later. The database and php scripts are included for anyone interested but not necessary for the script to run.
